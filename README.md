# eigen_ROS
This tutorial is how to use the eigen library to compute matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms

Before to install eigen library we need to learn how run C++ code in ROS

## **1. Run code C++ in ROS**

**Create a workspace**
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```
